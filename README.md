# UnityGridPractice
This is the Unity Grid Practice. I am working on an original game and I need to learn how to use a Grid System or a component in order to make this game a reality

We are practicing a Grid in Unity. This Grid is created using a script. I will also be practicing card game mechanics as well. Like a hand and how to play cards, draw cards, roll dice, place characters from the card onto the board.
